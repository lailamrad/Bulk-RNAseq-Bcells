Figure 4. Systemic changes in B cells after OVA NP-treatment include increase in regulatory B cell marker expression and suppression of immune activation. Mice sensitized with OVA-alum on days 0 and 14 were treated with OVA NPs on days 28 and 42. On day 44, spleens were processed into single-cell suspensions, and B cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting of negatively-selected CD19+ cells for bulk RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed regulatory Breg markers between OVA NP- and PBS-treated mice are displayed in a heatmap of regularized log transformed data that is centered and scaled across rows (A). The top 10 differentially expressed genes by fold change in both OVA NP- and PBS-treated mice are displayed in a volcano plot (B). Over Representation Analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO) terms of differentially expressed genes (C).
