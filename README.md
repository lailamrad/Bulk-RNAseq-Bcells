# Bulk RNAseq of Allergic and Nanoparticle-treated Murine B cells in OVA-alum Allergy Model

Data and study design is publically available in the NIH GEO Database at Accession ID: GSE301060 (Not available until paper submission)

Study Summary: 
Polymeric allergen-loaded nanoparticles were used as a treatment for a murine model of food allergies. To study changes in B cell gene expression due nanoparticle treatment, bulk RNA sequencing of B cells from the peyer’s patches (PP) and spleen was done after treatment. 

- OVA-alum sensitized female Balb/cJ mice (Day 0 and 14)
- Treatment: i.v. with 2.5 mg of OVA NPs, 100 µg solubilized OVA, or 100 µL vehicle (PBS) (Day 28 and 42)
- Tissue Extraction and Sample Preperation: RNA isolated from B cells from the peyer’s patches (PP) and spleen (Day 44)
- Bulk RNAseq: >30M reads/sample, polyA-enriched, pair-end, Illumina NovaSeq 6000
